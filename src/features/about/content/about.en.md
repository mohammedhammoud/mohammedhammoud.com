## Background

I'm Mohammed, a developer based in Stockholm. For over 13 years I've built web and mobile products across agency work, product teams and my own consultancy.

At Will & Skill I spent four years delivering for clients including Samsung, Nike and Ericsson. I later joined the Telia Play streaming platform and led the migration of the mobile app from a legacy hybrid setup to React Native. I continue to run The Clever Company for selected client projects.

Since 2022 I've been with Telia Company, starting with TV4 before the departments merged. Today I'm Tech Lead and Community Lead, focused on technical direction, shared practices and collaboration across the web and smart TV teams.

## What I work with

My primary frontend language is TypeScript. I mainly work with React and SolidJS, often in design systems and component libraries. On mobile I build with React Native and have earlier experience with native iOS in Swift.

On the backend I work with Node.js, Python and Django, typically building REST APIs. I've also used GraphQL in production when it fits the domain. I'm comfortable with PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, AWS and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.

## How I think about work

I aim for software that stays understandable and easy to change over time. My background in interaction design and HCI at Kristianstad University keeps user experience close, even in backend decisions.

## Outside work

I'm exploring cybersecurity and currently working through Google's Cybersecurity Certificate, with a long-term interest in application and cloud security.

I speak English, Swedish and Arabic.
