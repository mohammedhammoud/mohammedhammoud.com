## Background

I'm Mohammed, a developer based in Stockholm. For over 13 years, I've built web and mobile products across agencies, product teams, and my own company.

I started out as a web developer at the Swedish Armed Forces, then spent four years at Will & Skill delivering for clients including Samsung, Nike, Ericsson, and Telia.

I joined Telia Play in 2018, later founded The Clever Company, and continued as an independent consultant. In 2022, I returned to Telia Company, initially in TV4, working on C More and Telia Play. Today, I'm at Telia Play as a Tech Lead and Community Lead, driving technical decisions, shared ways of working, and collaboration across the Web and Smart TV teams.

## What I work with

I build products primarily in TypeScript, using React and SolidJS. I care about clear module boundaries, reusable UI patterns, and predictable data flows that make systems easier to understand and evolve.

I've worked in both monorepos and standalone setups, and I aim to build shared foundations when it makes sense: reusable components, common utilities, and consistent conventions that scale across teams and products. My workflow typically includes Vite, Storybook, linting, type checks, and automated tests (unit and end-to-end).

On the backend I build APIs with Python/Django and Node.js, choosing REST or GraphQL depending on the use case. I'm comfortable taking products from development to production using Docker and CI/CD pipelines.

I try to keep solutions simple and easy to change over time, with user experience in mind.

## Outside work

I'm exploring cybersecurity and currently working through Google's Cybersecurity Certificate, with a long-term interest in application and cloud security.

I speak English, Swedish, and Arabic.
